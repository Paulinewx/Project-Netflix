## Problematic 
In this project, the problematic we analyzed is the following : the evolution of Netflix content in the world 

## Workflow 
The different steps we followed are :
* First step 
We worked together to find a subject where we can find a dataset with a significative amount of data and a general problematic to use a guideline on our data viz project.
We started by cleaning the data : removing useless data and subquestions for our general question 

* Second step
We first started to brainstorm on graphics we could use in our projects and pursued the analyze 

* Last step
On the last day, we finalized our code and worked on our presentation in order to present it
